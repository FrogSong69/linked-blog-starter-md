[WPScan](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan) is an automated WordPress scanner and enumeration tool.


WPScan is also able to pull in vulnerability information from external sources. We can obtain an API token from [WPVulnDB](https://wpvulndb.com/), which is used by WPScan to scan for PoC and reports. The free plan allows up to 75 requests per day. To use the WPVulnDB database, just create an account and copy the API token from the users page. This token can then be supplied to wpscan using the `--api-token parameter`.

```shell-session
wpscan --url http://block.inlanefreight.local
```
