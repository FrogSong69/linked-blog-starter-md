As we can see above a number like 32 is represented by two separate binaries first the binary for 3 and then the binary for 2.

There are 4 transformations in the encryption process

In the image above we can see the rounds we pass though the middle section 9 times before going to the final round

What does each round do

In the image above we can see that 19 would give us d4 note that this process gets done with all bytes

This will also be done for the 3 other rows

This will also be done for the 3 other rows


How do we find a key round?

The 8a row is Wi-1 row shifted 1 up and then preformed sub bytes
