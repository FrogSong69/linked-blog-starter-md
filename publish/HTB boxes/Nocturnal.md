We are given an ip of 10.10.11.64

if we go to the ip we get redirected to http://nocturnal.htb/ which we need to add to /etc/hosts 

echo "10.10.11.64 nocturnal.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

Do as scan to spot open ports 
rustscan -a 10.10.11.64

we see there are not unusual tpc ports open

A few things that aer interesting right off the back we have login as well as file upload.


When uploading any file you will get a message:
Invalid file type. pdf, doc, docx, xls, xlsx, odt are allowed.

so my initial thought is that we can do something like this 
`shell.php` â†’ `shell.php.doc`

if we check use burp while uploading
```

What we know now 


We can upload normally

we can download our uploaded files from any username as long as we have the file name
http://nocturnal.htb/view.php?username=test&file=shellz5.odt

we can reupload from any username 
http://nocturnal.htb/uploads.doc?username=test&file=shellz5.odt

http://nocturnal.htb/uploads.doc?username=er&file=test.php.doc

At this point I want to just fuzz for a username and file,
